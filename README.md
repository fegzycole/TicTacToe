<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project, We are expected to build a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

### Objective
 - To get a better understanding of OOP concepts
 
### Assignment:
Full requeriments for the practice are in [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop)


### Built With
This project was built using Ruby. 


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Prerequisite
  - Git
  - Ruby

## Rules Of The Game
  - Player X begins the game
  - Each player can only pick a postion on the board from 1 - 9
  - Each player can only pick a position that hasn't been picked

The use of the code is for sorting arrays of numbers and strings using the bubble sort algorithm.
