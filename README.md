<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, we built a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

### Objective

 -Getting experience with OOP concepts in Ruby
 
### Assignment

Full requeriments for the practice are in [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop)

### Built With

This project was built using Ruby. 

## Prerequisites
 - Git
 - Ruby


## Getting Started

- git clone https://github.com/fegzycole/TicTacToe.git

- cd TicTacToe

- Type **bin/main.rb** in your terminal to run the executable


## Rules
1. THe game can only be played by 2 players (Player X and Player O)

2. Player X begins the game

3. Each player can only take one position at a time

4. Each player can only pick a position between 1 - 9

5. Each player can only pick a position that has not been picked previously

6. A player wins if three cells in the board match either horizontally, vertically or diagonally

7. The game comes to a draw if all cells in the board have been exhausted and there still is no winner.
